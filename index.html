                <p>I am student at Iowa State University. This semester, I'm taking multiple
                    project classes working with Java, CSS, HTML, and C/C++. I'm working with Web
                    Development, embedded systems, and a class focusing on connecting client to server 
                    side data while developing an app.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://github.com/afrizzell24/formulaOneWorldChampionship">Formula One World Championship</a></h3>

                    <p>This is my first personal project. Created with Java, this project simulates a shortened
                        version of the 2024 Formula One Season. The program randomly creates a "vehicle performance"
                        stat for each team and a "driver skill" stat for each driver. These stats are combined and
                        taken into account for each lap of every race. The program also tracks which driver has the
                        fastest lap, because if that driver finishes in the top 10 they get 1 additional Championship
                        point. At the end of the season, the program displays which team wins the "Constructors Championship"
                        and which driver wins the "Driver's Championship".
